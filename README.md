## Large scale collective behavior silumation with parallel computing
Collective behavior is an ubiquitos phenomena across many differnt animals in nature. Fish schools are examples of systems whose collective dynamics emerge from individual-level interac-tions. These systems are often modeled with self-propelled particles in unbounded domains subject to phenomenological behavioral rules based on visual feedback that usually neglect hydrodynamic interac-tions among the fish. This pair-wise interaction could be very costly in large scale. This project will focues on collective behavior in large scale.
